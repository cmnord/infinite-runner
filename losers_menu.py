#  \brief A (very simple) example of using the menu system
#  \author Scott Barlow
#  \date 2009
#  \version 1.0.0
#
#  An example script to create a window and explore some of the features of the
#  menu class I've created.  This script just creates a very simple menu for
#  users that just want to see a plain and simply menu.  This could be made even
#  more simple, but I keep some features I deem "essential" (such as
#  non-blocking code and only updating the portion of the screen that changed).
